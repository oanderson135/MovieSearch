[![Review Assignment Due Date](https://classroom.github.com/assets/deadline-readme-button-22041afd0340ce965d47ae6ef1cefeee28c7c493a6346c4f15d667ab976d596c.svg)](https://classroom.github.com/a/qaHNKmbC)
 For this assignment I would like you to create a simple web page that acts as a pseudo Movie Search database. In the repository there is a JavaScript file that contains an array of movie objects, with each containing a movie title, release year, and plot summary. I would like you to create the HTML and JavaScript necessary to do the following:
 - Allow the user to perform a case insensitive search on the movies by title. You **do not** need to make it account for typos or anything like that, just exact matches. (Check out string.includes())
 - Display the *first* match to the page. Include all 3 properties of the object
 - If no match is found then display a message indicating that there are no matching movies

 Just like our past assignments, I'd like you to publish this with GitHub pages and supply the link to the D2L quiz.
